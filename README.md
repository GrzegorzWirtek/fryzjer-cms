## General info

I created the website as part of a project involving three parts: backend, CMS and static website. This is a CMS. The user, once properly logged in, gains access to manage content on the salon website. The app allows user to add, edit and delete content stored in MongoDb Atlas, as well as upload and delete images stored in Firebase Storage. The site has a layout similar to the frontend section, but includes additional buttons for editing data. App was created with React.js, TypeScript and Sass/SCSS. State menagement is done using Redux.
